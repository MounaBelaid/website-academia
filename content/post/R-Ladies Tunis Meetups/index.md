[R-Ladies Tunis](https://rladies.org/tunisia-rladies/) is a local chapter of [R-Ladies Global](https://www.rladies.org ), an organization that promotes gender diversity in the R community worldwide.

We are a group of Tunisian ladies passionate about R programming. We are from different backgrounds : data scientists, business analysts, bioinformaticians, biostatisticians, etc.

We aim meetup in person or virtually to learn about the R programming language, algorithms and advanced tools using R. You might keep an eye out for [our Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-tunis/).

Our priority is to provide a safe community space for anyone identifying as a minority gender who is interested in working with R.

We exchange materials, discuss any issues we have on working with R, and receive news and updates about R. We are really a part of great community. More details [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP7x579SavE&t=1s)

Please find below a list of the previous and upcoming meetups organized by R-Ladies Tunis. You are welcome to join us!
